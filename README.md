# Li Long Yin - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm @longyin720. I graduated with a BSc Chemistry degree at the University of Nottingham. Due to enormous interest towards data analytics , I self-taught core data analytics skills such as SQL, Python and Tableau while working. I'm especially fascinated to apply my knowledge and skills on marketing and Fintech field and investment field as examining customer behaviour and stock performance brings lots of joy and satisfaction to me. This account is to store my projects which showcases my data analytical skills.
