# Li Long Yin - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm @longyin720. I graduated with a BSc Chemistry degree at the University of Nottingham. Due to enormous interest towards data analytics , I self-taught core data analytics skills such as SQL, Python and Tableau while working. I'm especially fascinated in data analytics as successfully finding insights from data brings lots of joy and satisfaction to me. This account is to store my projects which showcases my data analytical skills.
